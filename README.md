ADC 2022 Avaliação Individual

Hello, this is my individual project for the ADC course. It's a simple web application
where you can create and manage users, that can have several different roles, such as USER, GBO (back-office manager),
GS (systems manager) and SU (superuser). 
You can log in, and do several operations, as deleting other users (or self), listing users (the list having different
conditions/attributes depending on the role of who's calling the operation), update own or other's attributes,
update password, show the authentication token and logout. All of the operations are supported with authentication (tokens).
All of the operations work with a website interface (forms and so on) with the exception of creating optional attributes and
updating attributes, these two have a working logic, but I only made it work on postman.
On boot, the system gives us a superuser.

The project was made using eclipse IDE (with JDK 11), google app engine, html, javascript and ajax for the server/client communications.
